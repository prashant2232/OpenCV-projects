# 🧠 OpenCV Projects – AI Summer 2025

This repository contains my beginner-level **Computer Vision** projects built using **OpenCV and Python** as part of my self-learning journey in AI during Summer 2025.

## 📌 Projects

### 1. 🎨 Virtual Paint  
A real-time application that lets you "paint" in the air with the same color as that object. 
- Uses color detection and contour tracking  
- Allows freehand drawing via webcam

> 📁 [`Project1/`](./virtual-paint)

---

### 2. 🚗 Number Plate Detection  
Detects vehicle number plates in live video using Haar Cascades.  
- Triggers a snapshot when a plate is detected  
- Great for parking/traffic systems

> 📁 [`Project2/`](./numberplate-detection)

---

### 3. 📄 Document Scanner  
Simulates a real document scanner by detecting edges and applying a perspective transform.  
- Edge detection using Canny + Contours  
- Applies warp transform to generate a scanned version
- saves the detected number plate

> 📁 [`Project3/`](./document-scanner)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PyCharm (for development)
